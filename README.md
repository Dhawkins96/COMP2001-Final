# COMP2001-Final
This repro is spilt into two main sections. Part 1 is a zipped file which contains all the source files for my RESTfull API. Part 2 is my PHP application that displays my chosen dataset from Data Plymouth. 
I also have a folder which contains all my the SQL script for my API project - titled SQL Scripts.

The API is using the ASP.NET Framework Core and is linked with a Mircosoft SQL Server. The SQL has 3 different tables in with 4 stored procedures, a trigger and a view. The trigger and view arent explosed to the API currently they are just for future development.

The second part of this project was to create an example linked data application using PHP coding language that provides both human readable and machine-readable information about a specific dataset.

As you can see above is my current home page, it is a simple design for what it needs.

Next you can see the JSON machine readable data.

Finally, the human readable data shown in a table.
